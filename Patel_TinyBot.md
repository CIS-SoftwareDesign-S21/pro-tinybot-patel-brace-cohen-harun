# TinyBot

## Project Abstract
The project that I am proposing is a stand-alone project. TinyBot is a discord bot that will be used by the users to play minigames with eachother. The users will be able 
to invite the bot into their server and play against each other by creating an invite and having someone on the server accept the invite. The bot will also have a database that will allow the user to be able to view their game statistics, how many games they have won so far, and a leaderboard that will show who has most wins in the server. The games that will be implemented are tic-tac-toe, mini-chess, battleship, coin flip, and more.

## Project Relevance
TinyBot meets a lot of key educational goals. This project would cover topics such as test driven development, UML, debugging, graphic user interface, access to database, design patterns, and code profiling and optimization. We will also meet the practical experience in using modern software development tools using project management, test, and issue tracking on Github.

## Conceptual Design
It is still a work in progress in my mind but so far I have planned to create the whole discord bot obviously. There will be couple of features that will be implemented such as multiple games as mentioned in abstraction, the user picking a game and creating an invite, the challenger accepting the invite which will link the two and start the game, each user will take turns to make their move, once the game is over the result will be recorded on the data to view later by the users. I am also planning to create a leaderboard specific to each server that will keep track of who has won the most games within that server and so on. 

## Background

***Building***
- Will be written in python and JavaScript
- Corporate Python and JavaScript using pyjs
- Need a Discord Developers account
- Need to create a bot on discord first then code it.
- Need to create a discord server to test the bot

**Running**
- You can run and test it by creating a server and adding the bot on the server
- You can simply run the main script on your computer to run the bot

## Required Resources
Discord, Python3, Discord.py API
