# Project Overview
TinyBot is a discord bot that can be used by the users to play mini-games with each other. The Player is able to invite and challenge other players in the same discord channel.
There are multiple games that users can choose from. 
The bot has a database that stores the scoring records & game history to see how many games the user has won against other users.

# Vision

The TinyBot is a Discord bot for both gamers and casual users that introduces PVP minigames such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Chess alongside a leaderboard system that records users' game history. Unlike online websites or moblie apps that require the user to exchange personal information or add extra steps to invite people to play the game, our product allows the user to play with anyone on the server, providing an ease of access and usability.  

# Personas
### Ted, a high school student
Ted, aged 18, is a Senior in high school. Ted is an average student who does not take any honors or AP classes and has average grades. One of his hobbies is playing video games on his PC after school. He likes to play games such as Rocket League, Valorant, and Warzone. He and his friends use Discord to communicate while playing games. A single match of a game can take up to 10 minutes to an hour, and after a long session, he and his friends could cooldown by playing a game of tic-tac-toe or battleship before queueing up again. They often cannot decide what game to play, so instead of arguing with each other on what game to play, they could utilize the coin flip minigame to make their decision. Ted frequently finds himself waiting for his friend to get on the game or do a chore, so while he is waiting, Ted could play quick minigames against other users on the server to relieve his boredom.

### Frank, a security guard
Frank is a 38 year-old security guard who works night shifts at an apartment building. His job entails manning the desk in the apartment lobby, which brings extended periods of inactivity punctuated by infrequent interactions with apartment dwellers and Uber eats drivers. With nothing to do but passivley view the security cameras, Frank is often bored and looks online for intellectual stimulation and social interaction, both harder to come by during quarantine. TinyBot enables Frank to play simple games while talking with his friends on Discord. The games ease the boredom and can be interrupted at any time due to their turn-based gameplay, allowing Frank to deal with tenants and answer phone calls without having to worrying about pausing his game. Frank also gets to feel a sense of competitive accomplishment when he beats his friends in games and improves his rating on the server.

### Bob, a Game Club leader
Bob, is a 25 year-old student in University. He is a senior majoring in Computer Science. He likes to play games and is a game club leader in the university. 
Since most of the gamers use discord, he created a discord channel for his game club. The purpose was to communicate and get in touch with other members. He wanted to make the club active without in-person / face to face meetings.
He wants to use Tiny Bot to make more activities for his club discord channel. It may encourage the members to talk, play games, and participate in the channel during pandemic.

### Mitchell, a Professional Gamer
Mitchell, is a 23 year-old professional gamer, specifically playing a game DOTA 2. Mitchell grew up with a love for video games and spent many nights playing until the early morning with his brother. Mitchell always strived for perfection in any
game that he played, which caused a considerable amount of stress at times due to constantly practicing and feelings of slow progression. This has made it where at times Mitchell just wants to play some more simplistic minigames with his friends over discord.
The quarantine has made meeting up in person quite hard so this seemed to be the next best thing. A bot that allowed him to relax with his friends while still having a little bit of fun playing games that don't require a large amount of brain power.
