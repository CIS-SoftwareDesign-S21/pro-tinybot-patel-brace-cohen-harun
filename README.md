# Project Overview

# Vision

For all Discord users whether it be gamers or casual users who want to compete or have fun playing minigames, the TinyBot is a Discord bot that introduces minigames such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess and more, and a leaderboard system that records the game history. Unlike online websites or moblie apps that require the user to exchange personal information or add extra steps to invite people to play the game, our product allows the user to play with anyone on the server which provides an ease of access and usability.
