# Project Overview

# Vision

The TinyBot is a Discord bot for both gamers and casual users that introduces PVP minigames such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Chess alongside a leaderboard system that records users' game history. Unlike online websites or moblie apps that require the user to exchange personal information or add extra steps to invite people to play the game, our product allows the user to play with anyone on the server, providing an ease of access and usability.  

# Personas
### Ted, a high school student
Ted, aged 18, is a Senior in high school. Ted is an average student who does not take any honors or AP classes and has average grades. One of his hobbies is to play video games on his PC after school. He likes to play games such as Rocket Leauge, Valorant, and Warzone. He and his friends use Discord to communicate while playing games. A single round of a game can take 10 minutes to an hour and after a long session, he and his friends could cooldown by playing a game of tic-tac-toe or battleship before queueing up again. Often they cannot decide on what game to play, so instead of arguging with each other on what game to play they could use the coin flip minigame to make their decision. Ted often finds himself waiting for his friend to get on the game or go do a chore so while he is waiting Ted could play a quick minigames on Discord against other people in the server. 

### Frank, a security guard
Frank is a 38 year-old security guard who works night shifts at an apartment building. His job entails manning the desk in the apartment lobby, which brings extended periods of inactivity punctuated by infrequent interactions with apartment dwellers and Uber eats drivers. With nothing to do but passivley view the security cameras, Frank is often bored and looks online for intellectual stimulation and social interaction, both harder to come by during quarantine. TinyBot enables Frank to play simple games while talking with his friends on Discord. The games ease the boredom and can be interrupted at any time due to their turn-based gameplay, allowing Frank to deal with tenants and answer phone calls without having to worrying about pausing his game. Frank also gets to feel a sense of competitive accomplishment when he beats his friends in games and improves his rating on the server.
