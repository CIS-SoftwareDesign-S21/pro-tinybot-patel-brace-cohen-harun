# Project Overview

# Vision

The TinyBot is a Discord bot for both gamers and casual users that introduces PVP minigames such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Chess alongside a leaderboard system that records users' game history. Unlike online websites or moblie apps that require the user to exchange personal information or add extra steps to invite people to play the game, our product allows the user to play with anyone on the server, providing an ease of access and usability.  

# Ted, a high school student
Ted, aged 18, is a Senior in high school. Ted is an average student who does not take any honors or AP classes and has average grades. One of his hobbies is to play video games on his PC after school. He and his friends use Discord to communicate while playing games. After a long session of games, he, and his friends cooldown by playing tic-tac-toe on TinyBot. When they cannot decide what game to play, they use the coin flip minigame to decide. Ted also plays minigames on TinyBot when he has to wait for one of his friends to join the game.
